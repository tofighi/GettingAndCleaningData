# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

## Course Project

The R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Guidelines for running the project

1. Download run_analysis.R in an optional directory. 
2. Run source("run_analysis.R").
3. This script will automatically set working directory to your optional directory, download and install required dependencies automatically. It also download dataset zip file into the same directory. 
4. After preprocessing data, it will generate a new file ```tinydata.txt``` in your working directory.
